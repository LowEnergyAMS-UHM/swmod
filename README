swmod Instructions
------------------

swmod is a simple system to manage installations of software compiled
for different systems, both in a user home directory and in central
locations.

The software is managed in modules, which are placed in repositories.
The default repository is ~/.local/sw. The module "default" is
loaded by swmod during initialization. It has no version number and
is also the default install target.


Installing a software package
-----------------------------

swmod is currently geared towards software using an autoconf like
"configure/make" build system.

Configuration and installation:

    # swmod ./configure [OPTIONS]
	# make install
	
That's it. Now the software will be installed in

    ~/.local/sw/default/HOSTSPEC/

You can determine the HOSTSPEC for your system using the

    # hostspec

command. It will look like this: "linux-ubuntu-10.10-x86_64".

swmod should already have extended PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH and so on correctly.


Other module beside the default module
--------------------------------------

Use

	swmod setinst PATH VERSION
	
to determine the install location, module name and version. Use

	# swmod load MODULE[@VERSION]

to load a module, optionally a specific version of it. You may supply only a
part of the version number, for example to get the newest version "5.x" just
use "MODULE@5".
