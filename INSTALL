swmod Installation Instructions
-------------------------------

Note: swmod only works with bash!

Copy src/hostspec and src/swmod.sh in into a directory included
in your PATH (e.g. ~/bin, ...).

Add

    source swmod.sh init
	
to your ~/.bashrc resp. ~/.profile .
If you want to pre-load certain modules, also add something like

    source swmod.sh load root-system@5.30 &> /dev/null
